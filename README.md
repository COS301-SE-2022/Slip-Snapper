> “Nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without passion.” – Georg Hegel.  
> I am Regan Zhao, a BSc Computer Science Student at the University of Pretoria. Software development is my passion and I thrive in environments that mentally challenge me. I am goal-driven, curious and open-minded in every aspect of my life. I have experience in Android app development and Web development. In areas where I fall short of knowledge I strive to educate myself on these matters to the best of my abilities. Even though my future is uncertain, I'll continue to keep my head up and my passion ignited.
